# Test Website

This repository contains the code for my first website, created as a learning project while I was studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site was developed as a client-side only application, utilizing various APIs to enhance functionality.

## Description

- **Purpose**: The website was built as a test project to practice and implement the concepts I was learning in web development.
- **Technologies Used**:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - Various APIs

## Features

- Client-side functionality without any server-side languages like PHP.
- Basic design with a focus on CSS styling, following a more traditional website layout.
- Desktop-only view, as I was not familiar with responsive web design techniques at the time of creation.
